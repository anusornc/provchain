ProvChain is an innovative permissioned blockchain system that combines Block-DAG structure with PROV-O ontology and Knowledge Graph technology to create a high-throughput supply chain traceability solution. Using UHT milk production as a practical application case, the system tracks products from farm to consumer while overcoming limitations of traditional blockchain implementations.

## Architecture

The architecture leverages Elixir's concurrency model and combines three powerful paradigms:

1. **Specialized Block-DAG Structure**: A directed acyclic graph of blocks for high throughput and performance
2. **PROV-O Ontology**: Standardized provenance tracking using the W3C PROV-O model
3. **Knowledge Graph Technology**: Efficient traceability queries using graph-based data representation

The system includes a Hybrid Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus with a social trust model to ensure security while maintaining performance.
