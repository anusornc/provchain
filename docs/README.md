# Blockchain with DAG Storage, PROV-O & Knowledge Graph for UHT Milk Traceability

## Project Summary

This research project develops an innovative permissioned blockchain system that combines Block-DAG structure with PROV-O ontology and Knowledge Graph technology to create a high-throughput supply chain traceability solution. Using UHT milk production as a practical application case, the system tracks products from farm to consumer while overcoming limitations of traditional blockchain implementations.

The architecture leverages Elixir's concurrency model and combines three powerful paradigms: a specialized Block-DAG structure for high throughput, PROV-O ontology for standardized provenance tracking, and Knowledge Graph technology for efficient traceability queries. The Hybrid PoA consensus with social trust model ensures security while maintaining performance.

Our system aims to surpass existing blockchain solutions like PHANTOM through domain-specific optimizations, sophisticated materialized path strategies, and parallel validation pipelines that leverage Elixir's actor model.
